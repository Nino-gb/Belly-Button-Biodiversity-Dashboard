# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Dashboard

## Overview

The purpose of this Dashboard is to research bacteria species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. To find the species we have sampled the navels of people across the country to identified bacterial species that colonize in the belly button. Each participant identity is anonymous, instead they have been assigned an ID number. Fellow researcher and participant will be able to visit this website and see which bacterial species live in each participant. This dynamic Dashboard have a completed panel for demographic information and visualization that can be access by selecting the ID number to see the species results through the following charts;

- Horizontal Bar Chart display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found by volunteer 
- Bubble Chart display the amount, name and id of all bacterias found in each volunteer sample
- Gauge Chart displays the Belly Button weekly washing frequency of each volunteer, measure from 0-10 on the progress bar
